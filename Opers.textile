h2. What privileges do Opers have?

Every oper can do the following:

# Call a vote and vote on any issues/suggestions.
# Kill a local user
# Shun a hostmask (disallowing them from sending messages, this is useful to prevent a flooder).
# Temporarily ban a channel from being used. This should only be used to prevent illegal activity.
# Force and prevent a nick change on a user (until they reconnect). This is use to prevent nickname change spamming.
# Global/Local/Host-based/IP-based bans.

A Oper CANNOT do the following:

# Take over a channel
# Op themselves in a channel
# De-op another user in an IRC channel
# Cannot join a +i or +k channel
