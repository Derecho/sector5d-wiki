h2. Enabling SNOMASKS

To enable a SNOMASK you need to set the mode @+s <masks>@. For example you can add the @x@ mask by using the following command:

```
/MODE {nick} +s +x
```

You can then remove this mask using the following:


```
/MODE {nick} +s -x
```

You can remove all masks by doing:


```
/MODE {nick} -s
```

The #opers channel will receive snomasks @kox@, so you can see kill notices, ban notices and oper-up/oper-down/oper-fail notices.
