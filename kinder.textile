Kinder is powered by a Solaris distribution called [[OpenIndiana|http://openindiana.org/]]. Kinder is accessible via both IPv4 and IPv6.

|*Protocol*|*DNS*|*Address*|
|IPv4|ipv4.kinder.sector5d.org|93.97.27.108|
|IPv6|ipv6.kinder.sector5d.org|2001:470:1f09:d87::420|

h2. The Hardware

For security reasons Kinder is a virtual machine, (well a Solaris "Zone"). If someone gains access to the IRC 'Zone' they will not be able to control the whole server. The host system has the following specifications:

|*Motherboard*|ASUS M3N78-VM|
|*Memory*|Corsair 4GB (2x2GB) DDR2 1066MHz|
|*Processor*|AMD Athlon X2 5050e Socket AM2 45W|
|*PSU*|Corsair 400W CX PSU|
